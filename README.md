GaMD simulations are performed to enhance conformational sampling of proteins.By combining MM/GBSA method with GaMD simulation, post-processing analysis of MD trajectories is carried out, The key domains are detected and the reaction coordinates are obtained to construct the free energy landscape.The molecular mechanism of the effect of G12D mutation and ligand binding on the conformation dynamics of KRAS is revealed by using free energy profiles.
